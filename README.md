# Crypto Reports Hub

A centralized, org-wide platform for discovering, curating, and extracting insights from crypto industry research reports. 

This application allows users to upload local PDFs or external links to crypto reports, which are then processed by AI to automatically extract structured metadata, generate highly technical summaries, and produce dense audio briefings. The platform also automatically scans the web to discover, score, and ingest high-quality institutional research.

## Architecture

*   **Frontend:** HTML/Vanilla JS with a Dune-inspired Glassmorphism UI.
*   **Backend:** Vercel Serverless Functions (`/api/*`).
*   **Database:** Google Sheets (for structured metadata and easy administrative control).
*   **Document Storage & CDN:** Vercel Blob Storage (hosts PDF files and MP3 audio clips for instant, zero-latency delivery).
*   **Vector Database (Semantic Search):** Pinecone (indexes all report chunks for instant "Ask AI" queries).
*   **AI Processing:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (Summarization & Extraction), OpenAI TTS (Audio Generation), and Jina Reader API (PDF & Web Scraping).

## Key Features

1.  **AI Metadata Extraction:** Paste a URL, and the LLM instantly extracts the Title, Source, Date, Tags, and a dense 3-sentence summary.
2.  **60-Second Audio Briefings:** Click "Listen" on any report to hear a highly technical, non-fluff audio summary generated by OpenAI TTS. Audio is permanently cached to Vercel's CDN.
3.  **Semantic "Ask AI":** Chat directly with the reports. Queries are converted to embeddings and searched against the Pinecone Vector DB for instant, contextual answers.
4.  **Native PDF Uploads:** Directly upload local PDFs up to 3.5MB. Files are permanently hosted on Vercel Blob.
5.  **Automated Discovery:** A backend scraping script finds top-tier institutional reports (Messari, Binance, etc.), uses the LLM to score their quality out of 10, and automatically ingests reports that score 7 or higher.

## Setup & Local Development

To run this project locally, you will need the following environment variables configured in a `.env.local` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_key"
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_key" # For Search/Discovery
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gcp_key"    # Google Sheets API Support
SPREADSHEET_ID="your_sheet_id"
APPS_SCRIPT_URL="your_apps_script_url" # For append operations
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_vercel_blob_token"
```

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/elsaicequeen/crypto-report-hub.git`
2.  Install the Vercel CLI globally if you haven't already: `npm i -g vercel`
3.  Link the project to Vercel (optional, to pull env vars): `vercel link`
4.  Start the local dev server: `vercel dev`
5.  The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be hosted on Vercel. Pushing to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a production deployment if connected to a Vercel project.
